SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Peter McGuire Congressional Gold \\nMedal Act''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    The Congress finds following:\\n            (1) Peter McGuire's advocacy for the American Labor \\n        Movement led to great gains for American workers and their \\n        ability to organize and collectively bargain, especially in \\n        wages, worker solidarity, and the movement for the 8-hour \\n        workday.\\n            (2) Peter McGuire is known as the ``Father of Labor Day and \\n        of May Day'' for his contributions to American workers.\\n            (3) Mr. McGuire is recognized for building the United \\n        Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America into a \\n        powerful force advocating for American workers, and one of the \\n        most powerful labor organizations in the world.\\n            (4) Within 2 years, Mr. McGuire's St. Louis carpenters \\n        achieved such impressive success and wage gains that it \\n        attracted the attention of carpenters across the United States.\\n            (5) In 1881, Mr. McGuire called for a national meeting of \\n        carpenters' unions in Chicago which resulted in the formation \\n        of the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America, \\n        and was elected the United Brotherhood of Carpenters and \\n        Joiners of America's Chief Administrative Officer.\\n            (6) In 1881, Mr. McGuire wrote the convention call for the \\n        national conference of labor unions that established the \\n        Federation of Organized Trades and Labor Unions, which, in \\n        1886, reorganized into the American Federation of Labor.\\n            (7) Mr. McGuire was elected the first Secretary of the \\n        American Federation of Labor.\\n            (8) Mr. McGuire advocated admirably for an 8-hour workday, \\n        and his action resulted in meaningful gains for the 8-hour \\n        workday movement. Mr. McGuire led impactful strikes in 1886 and \\n        1890, which put the 8-hour workday on the minds of the American \\n        public. The latter strike resulted in especially impressive \\n        gains for workers, and one of the most successful strikes of \\n        the 19th century: over 23,000 carpenters in 36 cities gained \\n        the 8-hour workday, and 32,000 others gained the nine-hour \\n        workday.\\n\\nSEC. 3. CONGRESSIONAL GOLD MEDAL.\\n\\n    (a) Presentation Authorized.--The Speaker of the House of \\nRepresentatives and the President pro tempore of the Senate shall make \\nappropriate arrangements for the presentation, on behalf of Congress, \\nof a single gold medal of appropriate design in honor of Peter McGuire \\nin recognition of his contributions to the American Labor Movement.\\n    (b) Design and Striking.--For purposes of the presentation referred \\nto in subsection (a), the Secretary of the Treasury (referred to in \\nthis Act as the ``Secretary'') shall strike a gold medal with suitable \\nemblems, devices, and inscriptions, to be determined by the Secretary, \\nin consultation with the Secretary of Labor.\\n    (c) National Museum of American History.--\\n            (1) In general.--Following the award of the gold medal in \\n        honor of Peter McGuire, the gold medal shall be given to the \\n        Smithsonian Institution National Museum of American History, \\n        where it will be available for display as appropriate and \\n        available for research.\\n            (2) Sense of congress.--It is the sense of Congress that \\n        the National Museum of American History should make the gold \\n        medal awarded pursuant to this Act available for display \\n        elsewhere, particularly at appropriate locations associated \\n        with the American Labor Movement or the Gilded Age.\\n\\nSEC. 4. DUPLICATE MEDALS.\\n\\n    The Secretary may strike and sell duplicates in bronze of the gold \\nmedal struck under section 3, at a price sufficient to cover the costs \\nthereof, including labor, materials, dies, use of machinery, and \\noverhead expenses.\\n\\nSEC. 5. STATUS OF MEDALS.\\n\\n    (a) National Medal.--Medals struck pursuant to this Act are \\nnational medals for purposes of chapter 51 of title 31, United States \\nCode.\\n    (b) Numismatic Items.--For purposes of sections 5134 and 5136 of \\ntitle 31, United States Code, all medals struck under this Act shall be \\nconsidered to be numismatic items.\\n\\nSEC. 6. AUTHORITY TO USE FUND AMOUNTS; PROCEEDS OF SALE.\\n\\n    (a) Authority To Use Fund Amounts.--There is authorized to be \\ncharged against the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund such \\namounts as may be necessary to pay for the costs of the medals struck \\nunder this Act.\\n    (b) Proceeds of Sale.--Amounts received from the sale of duplicate \\nbronze medals authorized under section 4 shall be deposited into the \\nUnited States Mint Public Enterprise Fund.\\n                                 <all>\\n\\n\"},\n",

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Second Chance at Public Service Loan \\nForgiveness Act''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) The public service loan forgiveness program under \\n        section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \\n        1087e(m)) was created in 2007 to attract individuals to public \\n        service by forgiving an individual's Federal loans under part D \\n        of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1071 \\n        et seq.; 20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.) after 10 years of employment \\n        in areas of national need.\\n            (2) These public service careers, which include employment \\n        in military, emergency management, government, public safety, \\n        law enforcement, public health, education, child care, social \\n        work, services for individuals with disabilities, services for \\n        the elderly, public interest legal services, and library \\n        sciences, pay substantially less than similar careers in the \\n        private sector.\\n            (3) The public sector also repeatedly experiences workforce \\n        shortages, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n            (4) An undergraduate degree, certification, or advanced \\n        degree is a prerequisite to enter or advance in these public \\n        service careers. Yet, research suggests that the prospect of \\n        several decades of student loan payments often deters \\n        individuals from pursuing careers in public service.\\n            (5) The public service loan forgiveness program has \\n        substantially failed. In 2018, 99 percent of the borrowers who \\n        applied for relief under the program were denied due to \\n        improper type of loans, employment, or repayment plan, or the \\n        number of payments that they had made.\\n            (6) Advocates and enforcement agencies, including 38 State \\n        Attorneys General and the Bureau of Consumer Financial \\n        Protection, have repeatedly found that all of the major Federal \\n        student loan servicers provided inaccurate information to \\n        borrowers who were interested in or relying upon the public \\n        service loan forgiveness program. They also found that \\n        servicers repeatedly steered borrowers away from public service \\n        loan forgiveness into higher monthly payments and into \\n        deferment and forbearances.\\n            (7) This has caused millions of public servants irreparable \\n        economic harm, including preventing them from buying a home, \\n        opening a small business, starting a family, or retiring, \\n        because of their student debt.\\n            (8) Despite the recent actions of President Biden's \\n        administration to improve the public service loan forgiveness \\n        program, these actions are limited and will not fully atone for \\n        the repeated, pervasive, and systemic actions by Federal \\n        student loan servicers to prevent public servants from fully \\n        benefitting from this program.\\n\\nSEC. 3. MAKING FORGIVENESS ATTAINABLE FOR PUBLIC SECTOR WORKERS.\\n\\n    Section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \\n1087e(m)) is amended--\\n            (1) by striking paragraph (1) and inserting the following:\\n            ``(1) In general.--The Secretary shall cancel the balance \\n        of interest and principal due, in accordance with paragraph \\n        (2), on any eligible Federal Direct Loan not in default for a \\n        borrower who--\\n                    ``(A) obtained an eligible Federal Direct Loan on \\n                or after January 1, 1994;\\n                    ``(B) has been employed full-time in public service \\n                for a total period of 10 years or more after the date \\n                on which the first eligible Federal Direct Loan was \\n                obtained;

FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) In 1962, Congress authorized the first substantial \\n        Federal job training programs in the postwar period, to retrain \\n        workers displaced because of technological change.\\n            (2) For nearly 60 years, Federal workforce development \\n        programs have emphasized targeted education and job training \\n        and reemployment activities, service coordination and delivery, \\n        and a demand-driven approach that is responsive to consumer \\n        choice for participants and to the labor needs of local \\n        employers.\\n            (3) Now the 21st century economy demands systems that equip \\n        workers to be able to think critically and creatively, solve \\n        complex problems, make evidence-based decisions, adapt to \\n        evolving technologies, and work collaboratively.\\n            (4) Increasing 21st century skills development is linked to \\n        improving employment prospects and work success. Removal of \\n        structural barriers to employment prospects and work success, \\n        such as implicit bias, hiring discrimination, transportation \\n        gaps, and housing insecurity, requires raising employer \\n        responsibility and job standards and improving connections for \\n        individuals with barriers to employment.\\n            (5) Building on the functions of entities in the workforce \\n        development system, including aggregating data and acting as \\n        catalysts to promote careers with good pay, will contribute to \\n        fostering inclusive economic growth.\\n            (6) This Act, and the amendments made by this Act, will \\n        remove barriers to inclusive economic growth by allowing \\n        workers to access training opportunities through eligible \\n        providers of training services, including community colleges \\n        and registered apprenticeship programs, and by providing \\n        supportive services, including child care and transportation.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``No Tax Breaks for Union Busting \\n(NTBUB) Act''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress makes the following findings:\\n            (1) The National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et \\n        seq.) declares that it is the right of employees to form, join, \\n        or assist labor organizations.\\n            (2) The National Labor Relations Act further declares that \\n        it is ``the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes \\n        of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of \\n        commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when \\n        they have occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of \\n        collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers \\n        of full freedom of association, self-organization, and \\n        designation of representatives of their own choosing . . .''.\\n            (3) Despite Congress' intention to give workers full agency \\n        in these matters, many employers regularly choose to involve \\n        themselves, lawfully or unlawfully, in the decisions of their \\n        employees about whether to avail themselves of their rights \\n        under the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor \\n        Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.).\\n            (4) Employers frequently violate labor laws around \\n        organizing and collective action. The Economic Policy Institute \\n        finds that in approximately 4 of 10 labor organization \\n        elections in 2016-2017 employers were charged with committing \\n        an unfair labor practice. Among larger bargaining units of 61 \\n        employees or more, over 54 percent of elections have an unfair \\n        labor practice charge.\\n            (5) In practice, these unfair labor practices often include \\n        charges such as employees being illegally fired for labor \\n        organization activity, refusal to bargain in good faith with \\n        labor organizations, or coercion and intimidation. Employers \\n        also frequently use captive audience meetings, workplace \\n        surveillance, and other lawful or unlawful tactics to sway \\n        labor organization elections.\\n            (6) Whether or not there are charges of unlawful behavior, \\n        employers spend millions of dollars to sway the opinions of \\n        their employees with respect to whether or how to exercise \\n        their rights under the National Labor Relations Act and the \\n        Railway Labor Act. According to the Economic Policy Institute, \\n        companies spent $340,000,000 yearly on outside consultants to \\n        sway their workers' opinions about labor organization \\n        activities. This and other spending interfere with the United \\n        States goal of ``encouraging the practice and procedure of \\n        collective bargaining''.\\n            (7) The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has long recognized \\n        that spending by businesses with the purpose of influencing the \\n        general public with respect to elections, while it may be \\n        lawful, is not tax deductible. Congress should extend that \\n        principle to spending done by employers to influence workers' \\n        elections and collective bargaining decisions. These free \\n        choices to exercise the rights to engage in collective \\n        bargaining, labor organization representation, and other lawful \\n        collective activities should be made without taxpayer subsidies \\n        of undue outside influence from employers.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``No Tax Breaks for Union Busting \\n(NTBUB) Act''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress makes the following findings:\\n            (1) The National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et \\n        seq.) declares that it is the right of employees to form, join, \\n        or assist labor organizations.\\n            (2) The National Labor Relations Act further declares that \\n        it is ``the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes \\n        of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of \\n        commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when \\n        they have occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of \\n        collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers \\n        of full freedom of association, self-organization, and \\n        designation of representatives of their own choosing . . .''.\\n            (3) Despite Congress' intention to give workers full agency \\n        in these matters, many employers regularly choose to involve \\n        themselves, lawfully or unlawfully, in the decisions of their \\n        employees about whether to avail themselves of their rights \\n        under the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor \\n        Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.).\\n            (4) Employers frequently violate labor laws around \\n        organizing and collective action. The Economic Policy Institute \\n        finds that in approximately 4 of 10 labor organization \\n        elections in 2016-2017 employers were charged with committing \\n        an unfair labor practice. Among larger bargaining units of 61 \\n        employees or more, over 54 percent of elections have an unfair \\n        labor practice charge.\\n            (5) In practice, these unfair labor practices often include \\n        charges such as employees being illegally fired for labor \\n        organization activity, refusal to bargain in good faith with \\n        labor organizations, or coercion and intimidation. Employers \\n        also frequently use captive audience meetings, workplace \\n        surveillance, and other lawful or unlawful tactics to sway \\n        labor organization elections.\\n            (6) Whether or not there are charges of unlawful behavior, \\n        employers spend millions of dollars to sway the opinions of \\n        their employees with respect to whether or how to exercise \\n        their rights under the National Labor Relations Act and the \\n        Railway Labor Act. According to the Economic Policy Institute, \\n        companies spent $340,000,000 yearly on outside consultants to \\n        sway their workers' opinions about labor organization \\n        activities. This and other spending interfere with the United \\n        States goal of ``encouraging the practice and procedure of \\n        collective bargaining''.\\n            (7) The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has long recognized \\n        that spending by businesses with the purpose of influencing the \\n        general public with respect to elections, while it may be \\n        lawful, is not tax deductible. Congress should extend that \\n        principle to spending done by employers to influence workers' \\n        elections and collective bargaining decisions. These free \\n        choices to exercise the rights to engage in collective \\n        bargaining, labor organization representation, and other lawful \\n        collective activities should be made without taxpayer subsidies \\n        of undue outside influence from employers.\\n\\nSEC. 3. DENIAL OF DEDUCTION FOR ATTEMPTING TO INFLUENCE EMPLOYEES WITH \\n              RESPECT TO LABOR ORGANIZATIONS OR LABOR ORGANIZATION \\n              ACTIVITIES.\\n\\n    (a) In General.--Section 162(e)(1) of the Internal Revenue Code of \\n1986 is amended by striking ``or'' at the end of subparagraph (C), by \\nstriking the period at the end of subparagraph (D) and inserting ``, \\nor'', and by adding at the end the following new subparagraph:\\n                    ``(E) any attempt to influence the taxpayer's \\n                employees with respect to labor organizations or labor \\n

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Peter J. McGuire Labor Day Landmark \\nAct''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Peter J. McGuire joined the Cabinet Makers Union of New \\n        York in 1872 and, recognizing the need for one international \\n        union of wood workers, called for and led a convention of \\n        carpenters and joiners in Chicago in 1881 that formed the \\n        Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners which became the United \\n        Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America in 1888.\\n            (2) The Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners elected \\n        McGuire its first general secretary and retained him in that \\n        position for 20 years.\\n            (3) McGuire was a leader in convincing skeptical, locally \\n        minded union activists around the United States that a national \\n        labor federation was not only necessary, but also possible.\\n            (4) McGuire co-founded with Samuel Gompers the Federation \\n        of Organized Trades and Labor Unions and, in 1886, reorganized \\n        it into the American Federation of Labor.\\n            (5) McGuire served variously as the American Federation of \\n        Labor secretary and vice president between 1886 and 1900.\\n            (6) McGuire successfully led the fight for the 8-hour day \\n        in 1890.\\n            (7) In 1882, McGuire proposed that ``one day in the year be \\n        designated as Labor Day'', a proposal that was adopted first by \\n        a number of States and then as the first Monday in September by \\n        an Act of Congress in 1894.\\n            (8) Upon McGuire's death in 1906, the United Brotherhood of \\n        Carpenters and Joiners commissioned from M.C. Lyons and Sons, \\n        Camden, and had installed a massive granite multistage \\n        headstone on McGuire's gravesite in the Arlington Cemetery at \\n        1629 Cove Road, Pennsauken, New Jersey, inscribed with ``P.J. \\n        MCGUIRE, BORN JULY 6, 1852 DIED FEB. 18, 1906'' and ``FOUNDER \\n        OF U.B. OF C. & J. OF A.''.\\n            (9) Beginning in 1906, each year labor leaders, political \\n        leaders, families, and working people gather at McGuire's \\n        gravesite on Labor Day to lay wreaths and deliver speeches in \\n        tribute to McGuire and his great work.\\n            (10) As the anniversary of McGuire's centennial birthday \\n        approached, the organizations he had helped to found decided to \\n        install a new memorial a short distance from McGuire's \\n        gravesite, consisting of a central statue of McGuire embraced \\n        by a semi-circular colonnade of marble columns.\\n            (11) The Peter J. McGuire Memorial, completed in 1952, \\n        includes--\\n                    (A) an outdoor sculpture of McGuire, made of \\n                Cherokee Georgia marble, that shows him standing with \\n                his left arm against his chest and right arm, elbow \\n                bent, at his waist, and dressed in a frock or mourning \\n                coat;\\n                    (B) an inscription carved on front of the base of \\n                such sculpture that reads ``PETER J. MCGUIRE/JULY 6, \\n                1852/FEBRUARY 18, 1906'';\\n                    (C) a free-standing curvilinear colonnade of six \\n                Greek Doric columns, also made of Cherokee Georgia \\n                marble;\\n                    (D) an inscription on entablature frieze of the \\n                colonnade that reads ``IN MEMORY OF PETER J. MCGUIRE \\n                FOUNDER OF UBC AND FATHER OF LABOR DAY''; and\\n                    (E) an inscription on the base of the colonnade \\n                that reads ``ERECTED BY UNITED BROTHERHOOD OF \\n                CARPENTERS AND JOINERS OF AMERICA 1952''.\\n            (12) Several thousand people, many of them ordinary union \\n        members, attended the Peter J. McGuire Memorial dedication \\n        ceremony on August 9, 1952, which featured as speakers--\\n                    (A) the president of the New Jersey Federation of \\n                Labor;\\n                    (B) the mayors of Camden and Pennsauken;\\n                    (C) General President Hutcheson of the United \\n                Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners;\\n                    (D) the president of the American Federation of \\n                Labor, William Green;\\n                    (E) the secretary and treasurer of the American \\n                Federation of Labor, George Meany, who later attained \\n                national significance himself; and\\n                    (F) the United States Secretary of Labor, Maurice \\n                Tobin.\\n            (13) In 1956, when a new postage stamp dedicated to \\n        American labor was issued on Labor Day, President Dwight \\n        Eisenhower held a special ceremony at the White House in which \\n        he met with the family and descendants of McGuire.\\n            (14) In 2004, McGuire was admitted to the Labor Hall of \\n        Fame of the United States Department of Labor, which has since \\n        been renamed the Hall of Honor.\\n            (15) The New Jersey Historic Preservation Office has \\n        documented McGuire as a figure of transcendent national \\n        significance and importance in the labor history of the United \\n        States.\\n            (16) The landscape characteristics, physical features, \\n        overall layout, and visual appearance of the Peter J. McGuire \\n        Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite reflect a high degree \\n        of overall integrity in terms of location, design, setting, \\n        materials, and workmanship.\\n            (17) The sculptural representations of labor and union \\n        themes associated with McGuire's career as an effective labor \\n        leader and organizer that embellish the Peter J. McGuire \\n        Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are intact and well-\\n        preserved.\\n            (18) National political and labor leaders have made annual \\n        pilgrimages to McGuire's gravesite since 1906 and to the Peter \\n        J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite every \\n        September on Labor Day or the Friday before Labor Day since \\n        1952.\\n            (19) Unlike other known properties related to McGuire, the \\n        Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are \\n        the only properties that retain both the necessary direct \\n        association with McGuire as a person of national stature and \\n        the high level of integrity required for listing on the New \\n        Jersey Register of Historic Places and National Register of \\n        Historic Places.\\n            (20) The Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire \\n        Gravesite satisfy the criteria for graves of historical figures \\n        and properties that have achieved significance within the past \\n        50 years under the following criteria consideration categories \\n        of the National Register of Historic Places--\\n                    (A) category (c), ``a grave of a historical figure \\n                of outstanding importance as there is no appropriate \\n                site or building associated with McGuire's productive \\n                life''; and\\n                    (B) category (f), ``a property primarily \\n                commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or \\n                symbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional \\n                significance''.\\n            (21) In August 2017, the New Jersey State Historic \\n        Preservation Office certified that the Peter J. McGuire \\n        Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are eligible for \\n        listing on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and \\n        National Register of Historic Places.\\n            (22) On August 22, 2018, the Peter J. McGuire Memorial and \\n        Peter J. McGuire Gravesite were added to the New Jersey \\n        Register of Historic Places and, subsequently, on January 17, \\n        2019, added to the National Register of Historic Places.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Apprenticeship Hubs Across America \\nAct of 2023''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Registered apprenticeship programs provide apprentices \\n        employment with structured on-the-job training, little to no \\n        student loan debt, competitive wages, industry-recognized \\n        credentials, direct access to jobs and careers, and in some \\n        cases, the potential to earn college credit toward an \\n        associate's or bachelor's degree.\\n            (2) According to the Department of Labor, the average \\n        salary for an individual who completes an apprenticeship \\n        program is $77,000 annually. Apprentices who complete their \\n        program earn approximately $300,000 more during their career \\n        than peers who did not complete an apprenticeship.\\n            (3) There are still very few apprenticeship positions in \\n        sectors with high projected job growth. According to data from \\n        the Department of Labor, professional, scientific, and \\n        technical services--all industries with high projected job \\n        growth--had only 1,827 apprentices in fiscal year 2021. The \\n        field of health care and social assistance had less than 14,000 \\n        apprentices, much lower than the future projected need in the \\n        field.\\n            (4) A major barrier to expanding registered apprenticeships \\n        in high-growth job sectors is employers' lack of familiarity \\n        with the process to establish, and the requirements of, \\n        registered apprenticeship programs.\\n            (5) Workforce intermediaries, which are organizations at \\n        the national, regional, State, or local level that help ease \\n        the process for employers in developing and delivering new \\n        registered apprenticeship programs, can serve as a catalyzing \\n        force for creating and expanding registered apprenticeships in \\n        high-growth job sectors through technical assistance and \\n        capacity building for employers, labor organizations, \\n        educational institutions, and government entities.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Second Chance at Public Service Loan \\nForgiveness Act''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) The public service loan forgiveness program under \\n        section 455(m) of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. \\n        1087e(m)) was created in 2007 to attract individuals to public \\n        service by forgiving an individual's Federal loans under part D \\n        of title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1071 \\n        et seq.; 20 U.S.C. 1087a et seq.) after 10 years of employment \\n        in areas of national need.\\n            (2) These public service careers, which include employment \\n        in military, emergency management, government, public safety, \\n        law enforcement, public health, education, child care, social \\n        work, services for individuals with disabilities, services for \\n        the elderly, public interest legal services, and library \\n        sciences, pay substantially less than similar careers in the \\n        private sector.\\n            (3) The public sector also repeatedly experiences workforce \\n        shortages, especially following the COVID-19 pandemic.\\n            (4) An undergraduate degree, certification, or advanced \\n        degree is a prerequisite to enter or advance in these public \\n        service careers. Yet, research suggests that the prospect of \\n        several decades of student loan payments often deters \\n        individuals from pursuing careers in public service.\\n            (5) The public service loan forgiveness program has \\n        substantially failed. In 2018, 99 percent of the borrowers who \\n        applied for relief under the program were denied due to \\n        improper type of loans, employment, or repayment plan, or the \\n        number of payments that they had made.\\n            (6) Advocates and enforcement agencies, including 38 State \\n        Attorneys General and the Bureau of Consumer Financial \\n        Protection, have repeatedly found that all of the major Federal \\n        student loan servicers provided inaccurate information to \\n        borrowers who were interested in or relying upon the public \\n        service loan forgiveness program. They also found that \\n        servicers repeatedly steered borrowers away from public service \\n        loan forgiveness into higher monthly payments and into \\n        deferment and forbearances.\\n            (7) This has caused millions of public servants irreparable \\n        economic harm, including preventing them from buying a home, \\n        opening a small business, starting a family, or retiring, \\n        because of their student debt.\\n            (8) Despite the recent actions of President Biden's \\n        administration to improve the public service loan forgiveness \\n        program, these actions are limited and will not fully atone for \\n        the repeated, pervasive, and systemic actions by Federal \\n        student loan servicers to prevent public servants from fully \\n        benefitting from this program.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``No Tax Breaks for Union Busting \\n(NTBUB) Act''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress makes the following findings:\\n            (1) The National Labor Relations Act (29 U.S.C. 151 et \\n        seq.) declares that it is the right of employees to form, join, \\n        or assist labor organizations.\\n            (2) The National Labor Relations Act further declares that \\n        it is ``the policy of the United States to eliminate the causes \\n        of certain substantial obstructions to the free flow of \\n        commerce and to mitigate and eliminate these obstructions when \\n        they have occurred by encouraging the practice and procedure of \\n        collective bargaining and by protecting the exercise by workers \\n        of full freedom of association, self-organization, and \\n        designation of representatives of their own choosing . . .''.\\n            (3) Despite Congress' intention to give workers full agency \\n        in these matters, many employers regularly choose to involve \\n        themselves, lawfully or unlawfully, in the decisions of their \\n        employees about whether to avail themselves of their rights \\n        under the National Labor Relations Act and the Railway Labor \\n        Act (45 U.S.C. 151 et seq.).\\n            (4) Employers frequently violate labor laws around \\n        organizing and collective action. The Economic Policy Institute \\n        finds that in approximately 4 of 10 labor organization \\n        elections in 2016-2017 employers were charged with committing \\n        an unfair labor practice. Among larger bargaining units of 61 \\n        employees or more, over 54 percent of elections have an unfair \\n        labor practice charge.\\n            (5) In practice, these unfair labor practices often include \\n        charges such as employees being illegally fired for labor \\n        organization activity, refusal to bargain in good faith with \\n        labor organizations, or coercion and intimidation. Employers \\n        also frequently use captive audience meetings, workplace \\n        surveillance, and other lawful or unlawful tactics to sway \\n        labor organization elections.\\n            (6) Whether or not there are charges of unlawful behavior, \\n        employers spend millions of dollars to sway the opinions of \\n        their employees with respect to whether or how to exercise \\n        their rights under the National Labor Relations Act and the \\n        Railway Labor Act. According to the Economic Policy Institute \\n        report, companies spent $340,000,000 yearly on outside \\n        consultants to sway their workers' opinions about labor \\n        organization activities. This and other spending interfere with \\n        the United States goal of ``encouraging the practice and \\n        procedure of collective bargaining''.\\n            (7) The Internal Revenue Code of 1986 has long recognized \\n        that spending by businesses with the purpose of influencing the \\n        general public with respect to elections, while it may be \\n        lawful, is not tax deductible. Congress should extend that \\n        principle to spending done by employers to influence workers' \\n        elections and collective bargaining decisions. These free \\n        choices to exercise the rights to engage in collective \\n        bargaining, labor organization representation, and other lawful \\n        collective activities should be made without taxpayer subsidies \\n        of undue outside influence from employers.\\n\\nSEC. 3. DENIAL OF DEDUCTION FOR ATTEMPTING TO INFLUENCE EMPLOYEES WITH \\n              RESPECT TO LABOR ORGANIZATIONS OR LABOR ORGANIZATION \\n              ACTIVITIES.\\n\\n    (a) In General.--Section

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Apprenticeship Hubs Across America \\nAct of 2021''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Registered apprenticeship programs provide apprentices \\n        employment with structured on-the-job training, little to no \\n        student loan debt, competitive wages, industry-recognized \\n        credentials, direct access to jobs and careers, and in some \\n        cases, the potential to earn college credit toward an \\n        associate's or bachelor's degree.\\n            (2) According to the Department of Labor Apprenticeship \\n        Toolkit, the average wage for a fully-proficient worker who \\n        completes an apprenticeship is $50,000 annually. Apprentices \\n        who complete their program earn approximately $300,000 more \\n        during their career than non-apprenticeship workers.\\n            (3) There are still very few apprenticeship positions in \\n        sectors with high job growth. According to data from the \\n        Department of Labor, health care--the industry with the \\n        greatest job growth--had only 1,852 apprentices in 2016. \\n        Information technology, another sector with rapidly expanding \\n        job opportunities in the United States, had fewer than 1,000 \\n        apprentices in 2016.\\n            (4) A major barrier to expanding registered apprenticeships \\n        in high-growth job sectors is employers' lack of familiarity \\n        with the process to establish, and the requirements of, \\n        registered apprenticeship programs.\\n            (5) Workforce intermediaries, which are organizations at \\n        the national, regional, State, or local level that help ease \\n        the process for employers in developing and delivering new \\n        registered apprenticeship programs, can serve as a catalyzing \\n        force for creating and expanding registered apprenticeships in \\n        high-growth job sectors through technical assistance and \\n        capacity building for employers, labor organizations, \\n        educational institutions, and government entities.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Peter J. McGuire Labor Day Landmark \\nAct''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Peter J. McGuire joined the Cabinet Makers Union of New \\n        York in 1872 and, recognizing the need for one international \\n        union of wood workers, called for and led a convention of \\n        carpenters and joiners in Chicago in 1881 that formed the \\n        Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners which became the United \\n        Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America in 1888.\\n            (2) The Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners elected \\n        McGuire its first general secretary and retained him in that \\n        position for twenty years.\\n            (3) McGuire was a leader in convincing skeptical, locally \\n        minded union activists around the United States that a national \\n        labor federation was not only necessary, but also possible.\\n            (4) McGuire co-founded with Samuel Gompers the Federation \\n        of Organized Trades and Labor Unions and, in 1886, reorganized \\n        it into the American Federation of Labor.\\n            (5) McGuire served variously as the American Federation of \\n        Labor secretary and vice president between 1886 and 1900.\\n            (6) McGuire successfully led the fight for the eight-hour \\n        day in 1890.\\n            (7) In 1882, McGuire proposed that ``one day in the year be \\n        designated as Labor Day'', a proposal that was adopted first by \\n        a number of States and then as the first Monday in September by \\n        an Act of Congress in 1894.\\n            (8) Upon McGuire's death in 1906, the United Brotherhood of \\n        Carpenters and Joiners commissioned from M.C. Lyons and Sons, \\n        Camden, and had installed a massive granite multistage \\n        headstone on McGuire's gravesite in the Arlington Cemetery at \\n        1629 Cove Road, Pennsauken, New Jersey, inscribed with ``P.J. \\n        MCGUIRE, BORN JULY 6, 1852 DIED FEB. 18, 1906'' and ``FOUNDER \\n        OF U.B. OF C. & J. OF A.''.\\n            (9) Beginning in 1906, each year labor leaders, political \\n        leaders, families, and working people gather at McGuire's \\n        gravesite on Labor Day to lay wreaths and deliver speeches in \\n        tribute to McGuire and his great work.\\n            (10) As the anniversary of McGuire's centennial birthday \\n        approached, the organizations he had helped to found decided to \\n        install a new memorial a short distance from McGuire's \\n        gravesite, consisting of a central statue of McGuire embraced \\n        by a semi-circular colonnade of marble columns.\\n            (11) The Peter J. McGuire Memorial, completed in 1952, \\n        includes--\\n                    (A) an outdoor sculpture of McGuire, made of \\n                Cherokee Georgia marble, that shows him standing with \\n                his left arm against his chest and right arm, elbow \\n                bent, at his waist, and dressed in a frock or mourning \\n                coat;\\n                    (B) an inscription carved on front of the base of \\n                such sculpture that reads ``PETER J. MCGUIRE/JULY 6, \\n                1852/FEBRUARY 18, 1906'';\\n                    (C) a free-standing curvilinear colonnade of six \\n                Greek Doric columns, also made of Cherokee Georgia \\n                marble;\\n                    (D) an inscription on entablature frieze of the \\n                colonnade that reads ``IN MEMORY OF PETER J. MCGUIRE \\n                FOUNDER OF UBC AND FATHER OF LABOR DAY''; and\\n                    (E) an inscription on the base of the colonnade \\n                that reads ``ERECTED BY UNITED BROTHERHOOD OF \\n                CARPENTERS AND JOINERS OF AMERICA 1952''.\\n            (12) Several thousand people, many of them ordinary union \\n        members, attended the Peter J. McGuire Memorial dedication \\n        ceremony on August 9, 1952, which featured as speakers--\\n                    (A) the president of the New Jersey Federation of \\n                Labor;\\n                    (B) the mayors of Camden and Pennsauken;\\n                    (C) General President Hutcheson of the United \\n                Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners;\\n                    (D) the president of the American Federation of \\n                Labor, William Green;\\n                    (E) the secretary and treasurer of the American \\n                Federation of Labor, George Meany, who later attained \\n                national significance himself; and\\n                    (F) the United States Secretary of Labor, Maurice \\n                Tobin.\\n            (13) In 1956, when a new postage stamp dedicated to \\n        American labor was issued on Labor Day, President Dwight \\n        Eisenhower held a special ceremony at the White House in which \\n        he met with the family and descendants of McGuire.\\n            (14) In 2004, McGuire was admitted to the Labor Hall of \\n        Fame of the United States Department of Labor, which has since \\n        been renamed the Hall of Honor.\\n            (15) The New Jersey Historic Preservation Office has \\n        documented McGuire as a figure of transcendent national \\n        significance and importance in the labor history of the United \\n        States.\\n            (16) The landscape characteristics, physical features, \\n        overall layout, and visual appearance of the Peter J. McGuire \\n        Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite reflect a high degree \\n        of overall integrity in terms of location, design, setting, \\n        materials, and workmanship.\\n            (17) The sculptural representations of labor and union \\n        themes associated with McGuire's career as an effective labor \\n        leader and organizer that embellish the Peter J. McGuire \\n        Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are intact and well-\\n        preserved.\\n            (18) National political and labor leaders have made annual \\n        pilgrimages to McGuire's gravesite since 1906 and to the Peter \\n        J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite every \\n        September on Labor Day or the Friday before Labor Day since \\n        1952.\\n            (19) Unlike other known properties related to McGuire, the \\n        Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are \\n        the only properties that retain both the necessary direct \\n        association with McGuire as a person of national stature and \\n        the high level of integrity required for listing on the New \\n        Jersey Register of Historic Places and National Register of \\n        Historic Places.\\n            (20) The Peter J.

SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\\n\\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting the \\nTeaching profession through Revitalizing Investments in Valuable \\nEducators Act'' or the ``STRIVE Act''.\\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) States identified significant teacher shortages in \\n        their reports to the Department of Education during the 2017-\\n        2018 school year, with 46 States and the District of Columbia \\n        identifying shortages in special education, 47 States and the \\n        District of Columbia identifying teacher shortages in \\n        mathematics, 43 States identifying teacher shortages in \\n        science, 32 States identifying shortages in teachers of English \\n        learners, and 32 States identifying teacher shortages in career \\n        and technical education. One reason for the shortages in these \\n        areas is because mathematics and science teachers can earn \\n        significantly higher starting salaries in the private sector. \\n        Further, rural communities face limitations in recruiting and \\n        retaining teachers for reasons such as funding issues, limited \\n        teacher supply, and geographic isolation.\\n            (2) Students in high-poverty and high-minority schools, \\n        both urban and rural, typically feel the largest impact of \\n        teacher shortages. These schools often experience difficulty \\n        hiring and high turnover on a regular basis, and they are the \\n        most severely affected when teacher shortages become \\n        widespread. This happens, in part, because inequitable funding \\n        of schools leaves many low-wealth urban and rural communities \\n        with inadequate resources, so they must pay lower salaries and \\n        typically have poorer working conditions.\\n            (3) According to a study by Mathematica, when high-\\n        performing teachers were offered large financial incentives to \\n        transfer to low-performing schools, their students' scores \\n        climbed 10 points in reading and 9 points in math compared to \\n        students statewide over 2 years.\\n            (4) According to a survey conducted by Scholastic, 97 \\n        percent of teachers list supportive school leadership as \\n        essential or very important for retaining strong teachers and \\n        improving student achievement, more than any other factor.\\n            (5) Research suggests that incurring postsecondary \\n        education debt can decrease the likelihood that high-achieving \\n        students, lower-income students, and students of color choose \\n        to work in lower-wage professions in general, especially in the \\n        education system. Therefore, loan forgiveness and service \\n        scholarships for educators may be especially effective for \\n        recruiting teachers and school leaders from diverse, lower-\\n        income backgrounds.\\n            (6) According to the Learning Policy Institute, teacher \\n        loan forgiveness and service scholarship programs can be \\n        successful in both recruiting and retaining teachers. To be \\n        effective, these programs should provide a financial benefit \\n        that meaningfully offsets the cost of a teacher's professional \\n        preparation. This includes covering licensing and certification \\n        costs.\\n            (7) A 2015 Government Accountability Office study and a \\n        2018 follow up study by the Department of Education of Federal \\n        grant and loan forgiveness programs for teachers found that the \\n        structure of these programs matters. Further research shows \\n        effective loan forgiveness and service scholarship programs \\n        follow 5 design principles. These programs--\\n                    (A) cover all or a large percentage of tuition;\\n                    (B) target high-need fields or schools, or both;\\n                    (C) recruit candidates who are academically strong, \\n                committed to teaching, and well-prepared;\\n                    (D) commit recipients to teach with reasonable \\n                incentives to fulfill their commitment; and\\n                    (E) are bureaucratically manageable for \\n                participating teachers, local educational agencies, and \\n                institutions of higher education.\\n            (8) The TEACH grant program under subpart 9 of part A of \\n        title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070g \\n        et seq.) provides up to $16,000 in grants to prospective \\n        teachers who agree to teach in low-income schools and high-need \\n        subject areas for 4 years. This is far below the Department of \\n        Education's most recent estimate of the average annual cost of \\n        approximately $25,409 in tuition, fees, and room and board at \\n        the average full-time undergraduate 4-year institution.\\n            (9) The National Center for Education Statistics found that \\n        more than \\\\2/3\\\\ of the individuals entering the education field \\n        borrow money to pay for their higher education. Teachers with a \\n        bachelor's degree have an average debt of $20,000 and teachers \\n        with a master's degree have an average debt of $50,000. \\n        Teachers also start out earning 20 percent less than their \\n        peers with comparable degrees who pursue jobs outside of \\n        education. According to a report by the Center for American \\n        Progress, in more than 30 States, a mid-career teacher heading \\n        a family of 4 is eligible for several forms of government \\n        assistance, including the free and reduced-price lunch program \\n        for their children. These compounding factors can \\n        disincentivize prospective teachers from entering the \\n        profession.\\n            (10) In evaluating the TEACH grant program, the Government \\n        Accountability Office found that almost \\\\2/3\\\\ of the requests \\n        for assistance under the program from October 2011 through \\n        March 2014 cited problems submitting certification paperwork. \\n        The Government Accountability Office recommended improvements \\n        in the program's design, including reducing burdensome annual \\n        paperwork, increasing awareness about the program, and \\n        streamlining the dispute process.\\n            (11) Spending by teachers on school supplies adds up to \\n        $1,600,000,000 per year nationally. According to the Education \\n        Market Association, most teachers spend around $500, with 10 \\n        percent spending $1,000 or more.\\n            (12) Teacher quality partnerships are designed to \\n        strengthen higher education-based teacher and school leader \\n        preparation. Studies show that teachers who are better prepared \\n        to enter the classroom stay longer and perform better than \\n        their underprepared peers. Teacher quality partnerships also \\n        fund programs like induction and mentoring that have been shown \\n        to increase teacher and school leader retention. Research \\n        indicates that the ongoing support for teachers provided by \\n        teacher quality partnerships, including mentoring and coaching, \\n        is an important part of early childhood education programs.\\n            (13) According to the Center for Education Data and \\n        Research, a more diverse teaching workforce leads to better \\n        student outcomes, particularly in high-poverty environments \\n        with significant at-risk student populations. Further, \\n        researchers from Vanderbilt University found that greater \\n        racial and ethnic diversity in the principal corps benefits \\n        students, especially children of color. Three commonly cited \\n        rationales for this benefit are--\\n                    (A) students of color benefit from seeing minority \\n                adult role models in a position of authority;\\n                    (B) the higher expectations that teachers of color \\n                tend to place on students of color; and\\n                    (C) the effect of cultural differences between \\n                teachers of different backgrounds on instructional \\n                strategies and interpretation of students' behavior.\\n            (14) According to the report entitled ``Empowered \\n        Educators: How Leading Nations Design Systems for Teaching \\n        Quality'', effective teacher preparation successfully \\n        integrates theory and practice components. Further, according \\n        to the ``Preparing Teachers for a Changing World'' report \\n        sponsored by the National Academy Foundation, highly effective \\n        teachers vary in styles, yet have many teaching strategies in \\n        common. Research has identified a set of knowledge, skills, and \\n        dispositions essential for beginning teachers that should be \\n        incorporated into the teacher education curriculum. This \\n        includes the opportunity and capacity to reflect on and \\n        evaluate skills and to learn from practice. Evidence-based \\n        teacher preparation includes developing teacher skills, content \\n        knowledge, inquiry, and the capacity to provide effective \\n        learning experiences for a diverse set of students.\\n            (15) As it does in medicine, the Federal Government should \\n        maintain a substantial, sustained program of service \\n        scholarships or loan forgiveness programs that cover training \\n        costs in high-quality preparation programs at the undergraduate \\n        or graduate level for those who will teach in a high-need field \\n        or location for at least 4 years, as candidates are much more \\n        likely to remain in the profession and to make a difference for \\n        student achievement after 3 years of teaching. State \\n        governments can augment such an approach with programs targeted \\n        to specific local needs.\\n            (16) Research has shown the impact cultural competence can \\n        have on closing student achievement gaps and improving student \\n        outcomes by incorporating racial and ethnic minority \\n        contributions in curricula and diversifying pedagogical \\n        practices.

McGuire joined the Cabinet Makers Union of New \\n        York in 1872 and, recognizing the need for one international \\n        union of wood workers, called for and led a convention of \\n        carpenters and joiners in Chicago in 1881 that formed the \\n        Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners which became the United \\n        Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America in 1888.\\n            (2) The Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners elected \\n        McGuire its first general secretary and retained him in that \\n        position for twenty years.\\n            (3) McGuire was a leader in convincing skeptical, locally \\n        minded union activists around the United States that a national \\n        labor federation was not only necessary, but also possible.\\n            (4) McGuire co-founded with Samuel Gompers the Federation \\n        of Organized Trades and Labor Unions and, in 1886, reorganized \\n        it into the American Federation of Labor.\\n            (5) McGuire served variously as the American Federation of \\n        Labor secretary and vice president between 1886 and 1900.\\n            (6) McGuire successfully led the fight for the eight-hour \\n        day in 1890.\\n            (7) In 1882, McGuire proposed that ``one day in the year be \\n        designated as Labor Day'', a proposal that was adopted first by \\n        a number of States and then as the first Monday in September by \\n        an Act of Congress in 1894.\\n            (8) Upon McGuire's death in 1906, the United Brotherhood of \\n        Carpenters and Joiners commissioned from M.C. Lyons and Sons, \\n        Camden, and had installed a massive granite multistage \\n        headstone on McGuire's gravesite in the Arlington Cemetery at \\n        1629 Cove Road, Pennsauken, New Jersey, inscribed with ``P.J. \\n        MCGUIRE, BORN JULY 6, 1852 DIED FEB. 18, 1906'' and ``FOUNDER \\n        OF U.B.

OF A.''.\\n            (9) Beginning in 1906, each year labor leaders, political \\n        leaders, families, and working people gather at McGuire's \\n        gravesite on Labor Day to lay wreaths and deliver speeches in \\n        tribute to McGuire and his great work.\\n            (10) As the anniversary of McGuire's centennial birthday \\n        approached, the organizations he had helped to found decided to \\n        install a new memorial a short distance from McGuire's \\n        gravesite, consisting of a central statue of McGuire embraced \\n        by a semi-circular colonnade of marble columns.\\n            (11) The Peter J. McGuire Memorial, completed in 1952, \\n        includes--\\n                    (A) an outdoor sculpture of McGuire, made of \\n                Cherokee Georgia marble, that shows him standing with \\n                his left arm against his chest and right arm, elbow \\n                bent, at his waist, and dressed in a frock or mourning \\n                coat;\\n                    (B) an inscription carved on front of the base of \\n                such sculpture that reads ``PETER J. MCGUIRE/JULY 6, \\n                1852/FEBRUARY 18, 1906'';\\n                    (C) a free-standing curvilinear colonnade of six \\n                Greek Doric columns, also made of Cherokee Georgia \\n                marble;\\n                    (D) an inscription on entablature frieze of the \\n                colonnade that reads ``IN MEMORY OF PETER J. MCGUIRE \\n                FOUNDER OF UBC AND FATHER OF LABOR DAY''; and\\n                    (E) an inscription on the base of the colonnade \\n                that reads ``ERECTED BY UNITED BROTHERHOOD OF \\n                CARPENTERS AND JOINERS OF AMERICA 1952''.\\n            (12) Several thousand people, many of them ordinary union \\n        members, attended the Peter J. McGuire Memorial dedication \\n        ceremony on August 9, 1952, which featured as speakers--\\n                    (A) the president of the New Jersey Federation of \\n                Labor;\\n                    (B) the mayors of Camden and Pennsauken;\\n                    (C) General President Hutcheson of the United \\n                Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners;\\n                    (D) the president of the American Federation of \\n                Labor, William Green;\\n                    (E) the secretary and treasurer of the American \\n                Federation of Labor, George Meany, who later attained \\n                national significance himself; and\\n                    (F) the United States Secretary of Labor, Maurice \\n                Tobin.\\n            (13) In 1956, when a new postage stamp dedicated to \\n        American labor was issued on Labor Day, President Dwight \\n        Eisenhower held a special ceremony at the White House in which \\n        he met with the family and descendants of McGuire.\\n            (14) In 2004, McGuire was admitted to the Labor Hall of \\n        Fame of the United States Department of Labor, which has since \\n        been renamed the Hall of Honor.\\n            (15) The New Jersey Historic Preservation Office has \\n        documented McGuire as a figure of transcendent national \\n        significance and importance in the labor history of the United \\n        States.\\n            (16) The landscape characteristics, physical features, \\n        overall layout, and visual appearance of the Peter J. McGuire \\n        Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite reflect a high degree \\n        of overall integrity in terms of location, design, setting, \\n        materials, and workmanship.\\n            (17) The sculptural representations of labor and union \\n        themes associated with McGuire's career as an effective labor \\n        leader and organizer that embellish the Peter J. McGuire \\n        Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are intact and well-\\n        preserved.\\n            (18) National political and labor leaders have made annual \\n        pilgrimages to McGuire's gravesite since 1906 and to the Peter \\n        J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite every \\n        September on Labor Day or the Friday before Labor Day since \\n        1952.\\n            (19) Unlike other known properties related to McGuire, the \\n        Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are \\n        the only properties that retain both the necessary direct \\n        association with McGuire as a person of national stature and \\n        the high level of integrity required for listing on the New \\n        Jersey Register of Historic Places and National Register of \\n        Historic Places.\\n            (20) The Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire \\n        Gravesite satisfy the criteria for graves of historical figures \\n        and properties that have achieved significance within the past \\n        50 years under the following criteria consideration categories \\n        of the National Register of Historic Places--\\n                    (A) category (c), ``a grave of a historical figure \\n                of outstanding importance as there is no appropriate \\n                site or building associated with McGuire's productive \\n                life''; and\\n                    (B) category (f), ``a property primarily \\n                commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or \\n                symbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional \\n                significance''.\\n            (21) In August 2017, the New Jersey State Historic \\n        Preservation Office certified that the Peter J. McGuire \\n        Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are eligible for \\n        listing on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and \\n        National Register of Historic Places.\\n            (22) On August 22, 2018, the Peter J. McGuire Memorial and \\n        Peter J. McGuire Gravesite were added to the New Jersey \\n        Register of Historic Places and, subsequently, on January 17, \\n        2019, added to the National Register of Historic Places.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Apprenticeship Hubs Across America \\nAct of 2019''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Registered apprenticeship programs provide apprentices \\n        employment with structured on-the-job training, little to no \\n        student loan debt, competitive wages, industry-recognized \\n        credentials, direct access to jobs and careers, and in some \\n        cases, the potential to earn college credit toward an \\n        associate's or bachelor's degree.\\n            (2) According to the Department of Labor Apprenticeship \\n        Toolkit, the average wage for a fully-proficient worker who \\n        completes an apprenticeship is $50,000 annually. Apprentices \\n        who complete their program earn approximately $300,000 more \\n        during their career than non-apprenticeship workers.\\n            (3) There are still very few apprenticeship positions in \\n        sectors with high job growth. According to data from the \\n        Department of Labor, health care--the industry with the \\n        greatest job growth--had only 1,852 apprentices in 2016. \\n        Information technology, another sector with rapidly expanding \\n        job opportunities in the United States, had fewer than 1,000 \\n        apprentices in 2016.\\n            (4) A major barrier to expanding registered apprenticeships \\n        in high-growth job sectors is employers' lack of familiarity \\n        with the process to establish, and the requirements of, \\n        registered apprenticeship programs.\\n            (5) Workforce intermediaries, which are organizations at \\n        the national, regional, State, or local level that help ease \\n        the process for employers in developing and delivering new \\n        registered apprenticeship programs, can serve as a catalyzing \\n        force for creating and expanding registered apprenticeships in \\n        high-growth job sectors through technical assistance and \\n        capacity building for employers, labor organizations, \\n        educational institutions, and government entities.\\n\\nSEC. 3. DEFINITIONS.\\n\\n    In this Act:\\n            (1) Apprenticeship.--The term ``apprenticeship'' means an \\n        opportunity in a registered apprenticeship program.\\n            (2) In-demand industry sector.--The term ``in-demand \\n        industry sector'' means a sector described in subparagraphs \\n        (A)(i) and (B) of section 3(23) of the Workforce Innovation and \\n        Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3102(23)).\\n            (3) Institution of higher education.--The term \\n        ``institution of higher education'' has the meaning given the \\n        term in section 101 of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 \\n        U.S.C. 1001).\\n            (4) Local board.--The term ``local board'' has the meaning \\n        given such term in section 3 of the Workforce Innovation and \\n        Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3102).\\n            (5) Nontraditional apprenticeship occupation.--The term \\n        ``nontraditional apprenticeship occupation'' means an \\n        occupation that has not traditionally engaged in carrying out \\n        registered apprenticeship programs, but which the Secretary \\n        determines would benefit from having such a program (such as an \\n        occupation in a financial services, advanced manufacturing, \\n        information technology, health care, or hospitality industry \\n        sector).\\n            (6) Registered apprenticeship program.--The term \\n        ``registered apprenticeship program'' means a program \\n        registered under the Act of August 16, 1937 (commonly known as \\n        the ``National Apprenticeship Act''; 50 Stat. 664, chapter 663; \\n        29 U.S.C. 50 et seq.).\\n            (7) Secretary.--The term ``Secretary'' means the Secretary \\n        of Labor.\\n            (8) State board.--The term ``State board'' has the meaning \\n        given the term in section 3 of the Workforce Innovation and \\n        Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. 3102).\\n            (9) Workforce intermediary.--The term ``workforce \\n        intermediary'' means an entity that, at the national, regional, \\n        State, or local level--\\n                    (A)(i) facilitates the establishment of registered \\n                apprenticeship programs; or\\n                    (ii) if awarded a grant under this Act, has the \\n                capacity, and will work, to facilitate the \\n                establishment of registered apprenticeship programs; \\n                and\\n                    (B) may be a partnership that includes 1 or more of \\n                the following as partners:\\n                            (i) A business or industry organization.\\n                            (ii) A community-based organization.\\n                            (iii) A joint labor-management partnership.\\n                            (iv) An institution of higher education.\\n                            (v) A State board or local board.\\n                            (vi) A nonprofit organization.\\n                            (vii) An industry or sector partnership as \\n                        defined in section 3 of the Workforce \\n                        Innovation and Opportunity Act (29 U.S.C. \\n                        3102).\\n                            (viii) An industry association.\\n                            (ix) A joint labor-management organization.\\n                            (x) A consortium of organizations that \\n                        provide technical assistance to support and to \\n                        increase the development of registered \\n                        apprenticeship programs.\\n                            (xi) Any other entity that the Secretary \\n                        considers to be appropriate.\\n\\nSEC. 4.

FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Registered apprenticeship programs provide apprentices \\n        without college degrees a pathway to receiving structured on-\\n        the-job training, wages, industry-recognized credentials, and \\n        direct access to jobs and careers.\\n            (2) According to the Urban Institute, in contrast to higher \\n        education, in which just over half of students graduate with a \\n        bachelor's degree in 6 years, most apprenticeship programs have \\n        completion rates of 80 percent or better.\\n            (3) There are still very few apprenticeship positions in \\n        sectors with high job growth. According to data from the \\n        Department of Labor, health care--the industry with the \\n        greatest job growth--had only 1,852 apprentices in 2016. \\n        Information technology, another sector with rapidly expanding \\n        job opportunities in the United States, had fewer than 1,000 \\n        apprentices in 2016.\\n            (4) A major barrier to expanding registered apprenticeships \\n        in high-growth job sectors is employers' lack of familiarity \\n        with the process to establish, and the requirements of, \\n        registered apprenticeship programs.\\n            (5) Workforce intermediaries, which are organizations that \\n        help employers in developing and delivering new registered \\n        apprenticeship programs, can serve as a catalyzing force for \\n        expanding registered apprenticeships in high-growth job \\n        sectors.\\n\\nSEC. 3.

SHORT TITLE AND FINDINGS.\\n\\n    (a) Short Title.--This Act may be cited as the ``Supporting the \\nTeaching profession through Revitalizing Investments in Valuable \\nEducators Act'' or the ``STRIVE Act''.\\n    (b) Findings.--Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) States identified significant teacher shortages in \\n        their reports to the Department of Education during the 2015-\\n        2016 school year, with 48 States identifying shortages in \\n        special education, 42 identifying teacher shortages in \\n        mathematics, and 40 identifying teacher shortages in science. \\n        One reason for the shortages in these areas is because \\n        mathematics and science teachers can earn significantly higher \\n        starting salaries in the private sector. Further, rural \\n        communities face limitations in recruiting and retaining \\n        teachers for reasons such as funding issues, limited teacher \\n        supply, and geographic isolation.\\n            (2) Students in high-poverty and high-minority schools, \\n        both urban and rural, typically feel the largest impact of \\n        teacher shortages. These schools often experience difficulty \\n        hiring and high turnover on a regular basis, and they are the \\n        most severely affected when teacher shortages become \\n        widespread. This happens, in part, because inequitable funding \\n        of schools leaves many low-wealth urban and rural communities \\n        with inadequate resources, so they must pay lower salaries and \\n        typically have poorer working conditions.\\n            (3) According to a study by Mathematica, when high-\\n        performing teachers were offered large financial incentives to \\n        transfer to low-performing schools, their students' scores \\n        climbed 10 points in reading and 9 points in math compared to \\n        students statewide over 2 years.\\n            (4) According to a survey conducted by Scholastic, 97 \\n        percent of teachers list supportive school leadership as \\n        essential or very important for retaining strong teachers and \\n        improving student achievement, more than any other factor.\\n            (5) Research suggests that incurring postsecondary \\n        education debt can decrease the likelihood that high-achieving \\n        students, lower-income students, and students of color choose \\n        to work in lower-wage professions in general, especially in the \\n        education system. Therefore, loan forgiveness and service \\n        scholarships for teachers may be especially effective for \\n        recruiting teachers and school leaders from diverse, lower-\\n        income backgrounds.\\n            (6) According to the Learning Policy Institute, teacher \\n        loan forgiveness and service scholarship programs can be \\n        successful in both recruiting and retaining teachers. To be \\n        effective, these programs should provide a financial benefit \\n        that meaningfully offsets the cost of a teacher's professional \\n        preparation. This includes covering licensing and certification \\n        costs.\\n            (7) A 2015 Government Accountability Office study of \\n        Federal grant and loan forgiveness programs for teachers found \\n        that the structure of these programs matters. Further research \\n        shows effective loan forgiveness and service scholarship \\n        programs follow 5 design principles. These programs--\\n                    (A) cover all or a large percentage of tuition;\\n                    (B) target high-need fields or schools, or both;\\n                    (C) recruit candidates who are academically strong, \\n                committed to teaching, and well-prepared;\\n                    (D) commit recipients to teach with reasonable \\n                incentives to fulfill their commitment; and\\n                    (E) are bureaucratically manageable for \\n                participating teachers, local educational agencies, and \\n                institutions of higher education.\\n            (8) The TEACH grant program under subpart 9 of part A of \\n        title IV of the Higher Education Act of 1965 (20 U.S.C. 1070g \\n        et seq.) provides up to $16,000 in grants to prospective \\n        teachers who agree to teach in low-income schools and high-need \\n        subject areas for 4 years. This is far below the Department of \\n        Education's most recent estimate of the average annual cost of \\n        approximately $25,409 in tuition, fees, and room and board at \\n        the average full-time undergraduate 4-year institution.\\n            (9) The National Center for Education Statistics found that \\n        more than \\\\2/3\\\\ of the individuals entering the education field \\n        borrow money to pay for their higher education. Teachers with a \\n        bachelor's degree have an average debt of $20,000 and teachers \\n        with a master's degree have an average debt of $50,000. \\n        Teachers also start out earning 20 percent less than their \\n        peers with comparable degrees who pursue jobs outside of \\n        education. These compounding factors can disincentivize \\n        prospective teachers from entering the profession.\\n            (10) In evaluating the TEACH grant program, the Government \\n        Accountability Office found that almost \\\\2/3\\\\ of the requests \\n        for assistance under the program from October 2011 through \\n        March 2014 cited problems submitting certification paperwork. \\n        The Government Accountability Office recommended improvements \\n        in the program's design, including reducing burdensome annual \\n        paperwork, increasing awareness about the program, and \\n        streamlining the dispute process.\\n            (11) Spending by teachers on school supplies adds up to \\n        $1,600,000,000 nationally. According to the Education Market \\n        Association, most teachers spend around $500, with 10 percent \\n        spending $1,000 or more.\\n            (12) Teacher quality partnerships are designed to \\n        strengthen higher education-based teacher and school leader \\n        preparation. Studies show that teachers who are better prepared \\n        to enter the classroom stay longer and perform better than \\n        their underprepared peers. Teacher quality partnerships also \\n        fund programs like induction and mentoring that have been shown \\n        to increase teacher and school leader retention. Research \\n        indicates that the ongoing support for teachers provided by \\n        teacher quality partnerships, including mentoring and coaching, \\n        is an important part of early childhood education programs.\\n            (13) According to the Center for Education Data and \\n        Research, a more diverse teaching workforce leads to better \\n        student outcomes, particularly in high-poverty environments \\n        with significant at-risk student populations. Further, \\n        researchers from Vanderbilt University found that greater \\n        racial and ethnic diversity in the principal corps benefits \\n        students, especially children of color. Three commonly cited \\n        rationales for this benefit are--\\n                    (A) students of color benefit from seeing minority \\n                adult role models in a position of authority;\\n                    (B) the higher expectations that teachers of color \\n                tend to place on students of color; and\\n                    (C) the effect of cultural differences between \\n                teachers of different backgrounds on instructional \\n                strategies and interpretation of students' behavior.\\n            (14) According to the report entitled ``Empowered \\n        Educators: How Leading Nations Design Systems for Teaching \\n        Quality'', effective teacher preparation successfully \\n        integrates theory and practice components. Further, according \\n        to the ``Preparing Teachers for a Changing World'' report \\n        sponsored by the National Academy Foundation, highly effective \\n        teachers vary in styles, yet have many teaching strategies in \\n        common. Research has identified a set of knowledge, skills, and \\n        dispositions essential for beginning teachers that should be \\n        incorporated into the teacher education curriculum. This \\n        includes the opportunity and capacity to reflect on and \\n        evaluate skills and to learn from practice. Evidence-based \\n        teacher preparation includes developing teacher skills, content \\n        knowledge, inquiry, and the capacity to provide effective \\n        learning experiences for a diverse set of students.\\n            (15) As it does in medicine, the Federal Government should \\n        maintain a substantial, sustained program of service \\n        scholarships or loan forgiveness programs that cover training \\n        costs in high-quality preparation programs at the undergraduate \\n        or graduate level for those who will teach in a high-need field \\n        or location for at least 4 years, as candidates are much more \\n        likely to remain in the profession and to make a difference for \\n        student achievement after 3 years of teaching. State \\n        governments can augment such an approach with programs targeted \\n        to specific local needs.\\n            (16) Research has shown the impact cultural competence can \\n        have on closing student achievement gaps and improving student \\n        outcomes by incorporating racial and ethnic minority \\n        contributions in curricula and diversifying pedagogical \\n        practices. Cultural competence is both a moral and ethical \\n        responsibility to create a welcoming environment for students \\n        to succeed. The impact of having educators who have the ability \\n        to challenge and motivate diverse student populations can \\n        dramatically improve our educational system and student \\n        outcomes.\\n\\n TITLE I--IMPROVING TEACHER SUPPORT UNDER THE ELEMENTARY AND SECONDARY \\n                         EDUCATION ACT OF 1965\\n\\nSEC. 101.

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``The Peter J. McGuire Labor Day \\nLandmark Act''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) Peter J. McGuire joined the Cabinet Makers Union of New \\n        York in 1872 and, recognizing the need for one international \\n        union of wood workers, called for and led a convention of \\n        carpenters and joiners in Chicago in 1881 that formed the \\n        Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners which became the United \\n        Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners of America in 1888.\\n            (2) The Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners elected \\n        McGuire its first general secretary and retained him in that \\n        position for twenty years.\\n            (3) McGuire was a leader in convincing skeptical, locally \\n        minded union activists around the United States that a national \\n        labor federation was not only necessary, but also possible.\\n            (4) McGuire co-founded with Samuel Gompers the Federation \\n        of Organized Trades and Labor Unions and, in 1886, reorganized \\n        it into the American Federation of Labor.\\n            (5) McGuire served variously as the American Federation of \\n        Labor secretary and vice president between 1886 and 1900.\\n            (6) McGuire successfully led the fight for the eight-hour \\n        day in 1890.\\n            (7) In 1882, McGuire proposed that ``one day in the year be \\n        designated as Labor Day'', a proposal that was adopted first by \\n        a number of States and then as the first Monday in September by \\n        an Act of Congress in 1894.\\n            (8) Upon McGuire's death in 1906, the United Brotherhood of \\n        Carpenters and Joiners commissioned from M.C. Lyons and Sons, \\n        Camden, and had installed a massive granite multistage \\n        headstone on McGuire's gravesite in the Arlington Cemetery at \\n        1629 Cove Road, Pennsauken, New Jersey, inscribed with ``P.J. \\n        MCGUIRE, BORN JULY 6, 1852 DIED FEB. 18, 1906'' and ``FOUNDER \\n        OF U.B. OF C. & J. OF A.''.\\n            (9) Beginning in 1906, each year labor leaders, political \\n        leaders, families, and working people gather at McGuire's \\n        gravesite on Labor Day to lay wreaths and deliver speeches in \\n        tribute to McGuire and his great work.\\n            (10) As the anniversary of McGuire's centennial birthday \\n        approached, the organizations he had helped to found decided to \\n        install a new memorial a short distance from McGuire's \\n        gravesite, consisting of a central statue of McGuire embraced \\n        by a semi-circular colonnade of marble columns.\\n            (11) The Peter J. McGuire Memorial, completed in 1952, \\n        includes--\\n                    (A) an outdoor sculpture of McGuire, made of \\n                Cherokee Georgia marble, that shows him standing with \\n                his left arm against his chest and right arm, elbow \\n                bent, at his waist, and dressed in a frock or mourning \\n                coat;\\n                    (B) an inscription carved on front of the base of \\n                such sculpture that reads ``PETER J. MCGUIRE/JULY 6, \\n                1852/FEBRUARY 18, 1906'';\\n                    (C) a free-standing curvilinear colonnade of six \\n                Greek Doric columns, also made of Cherokee Georgia \\n                marble;\\n                    (D) an inscription on entablature frieze of the \\n                colonnade that reads ``IN MEMORY OF PETER J. MCGUIRE \\n                FOUNDER OF UBC AND FATHER OF LABOR DAY''; and\\n                    (E) an inscription on the base of the colonnade \\n                that reads ``ERECTED BY UNITED BROTHERHOOD OF \\n                CARPENTERS AND JOINERS OF AMERICA 1952''.\\n            (12) Several thousand people, many of them ordinary union \\n        members, attended the Peter J. McGuire Memorial dedication \\n        ceremony on Aug. 9, 1952, which featured as speakers--\\n                    (A) the president of the New Jersey Federation of \\n                Labor;\\n                    (B) the mayors of Camden and Pennsauken;\\n                    (C) General President Hutcheson of the United \\n                Brotherhood of Carpenters and Joiners;\\n                    (D) the president of the American Federation of \\n                Labor, William Green;\\n                    (E) the secretary and treasurer of the American \\n                Federation of Labor, George Meany, who later attained \\n                national significance himself; and\\n                    (F) the United States Secretary of Labor, Maurice \\n                Tobin.\\n            (13) In 1956, when a new postage stamp dedicated to \\n        American labor was issued on Labor Day, President Dwight \\n        Eisenhower held a special ceremony at the White House in which \\n        he met with the family and descendants of McGuire.\\n            (14) In 2004, McGuire was admitted to the Labor Hall of \\n        Fame of the United States Department of Labor, which has since \\n        been renamed the Hall of Honor.\\n            (15) The New Jersey Historic Preservation Office has \\n        documented McGuire as a figure of transcendent national \\n        significance and importance in the labor history of the United \\n        States.\\n            (16) The landscape characteristics, physical features, \\n        overall layout, and visual appearance of the Peter J. McGuire \\n        Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite reflect a high degree \\n        of overall integrity in terms of location, design, setting, \\n        materials, and workmanship.\\n            (17) The sculptural representations of labor and union \\n        themes associated with McGuire's career as an effective labor \\n        leader and organizer that embellish the Peter J. McGuire \\n        Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are intact and well-\\n        preserved.\\n            (18) National political and labor leaders have made annual \\n        pilgrimages to McGuire's gravesite since 1906 and to the Peter \\n        J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite every \\n        September on Labor Day or the Friday before Labor Day since \\n        1952.\\n            (19) Unlike other known properties related to McGuire, the \\n        Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are \\n        the only properties that retain both the necessary direct \\n        association with McGuire as a person of national stature and \\n        the high level of integrity required for listing on the New \\n        Jersey Register of Historic Places and National Register of \\n        Historic Places.\\n            (20) The Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. McGuire \\n        Gravesite satisfy the criteria for graves of historical figures \\n        and properties that have achieved significance within the past \\n        50 years under the following criteria consideration categories \\n        of the National Register of Historic Places--\\n                    (A) category (c), ``a grave of a historical figure \\n                of outstanding importance as there is no appropriate \\n                site or building associated with McGuire's productive \\n                life''; and\\n                    (B) category (f), ``a property primarily \\n                commemorative in intent if design, age, tradition, or \\n                symbolic value has invested it with its own exceptional \\n                significance''.\\n            (21) In August 2017, the New Jersey State Historic \\n        Preservation Office certified that the Peter J. McGuire \\n        Memorial and Peter J. McGuire Gravesite are eligible for \\n        listing on the New Jersey Register of Historic Places and \\n        National Register of Historic Places.\\n\\nSEC. 3. DESIGNATION OF PETER J. MCGUIRE MEMORIAL NATIONAL HISTORIC \\n              LANDMARK.\\n\\n    (a) Designation.--The Peter J. McGuire Memorial and Peter J. \\nMcGuire Gravesite, located in Pennsauken, New Jersey, are hereby \\ndesignated as the Peter J.

SHORT TITLE.\\n\\n    This Act may be cited as the ``Veterans Freedom of Healthcare \\nAct''.\\n\\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\\n\\n    Congress finds the following:\\n            (1) All veterans who have signed up to put their life on \\n        the line for the lives and liberty of the people of the United \\n        States deserve the opportunity to seek health care at a \\n        facility of their choice, regardless of arbitrary distance and \\n        wait-time thresholds.\\n            (2) Logistical impediments to veterans receiving health \\n        care at medical facilities of the Veterans Health \\n        Administration of the Department of Veterans Affairs, including \\n        with respect to travel, wait times, and enrollment difficulty, \\n        have been found to exist across all demographics of veterans \\n        and are widely cited among the most common barriers to \\n        receiving the health care the veterans earned.\\n            (3) As a result of widespread reporting on such \\n        impediments, including regarding the death of 40 veterans who \\n        died while waiting for health care at the Phoenix Veterans' \\n        Hospital, in 2014 Congress investigated the matter and \\n        confirmed that such impediments were pervasive and systemic.\\n            (4) As of September 30, 2014, there were approximately \\n        867,000 applications by veterans to enroll in the health care \\n        system of the Department, and the Inspector General of the \\n        Department could not determine how long more than half of the \\n        applications had been pending.\\n            (5) The Secretary of Veterans Affairs has been unable to \\n        meet the modest goal of employing one psychiatrist per 1,000 \\n        individual mental health patients of the Department.\\n            (6) The Inspector General found that approximately 70 \\n        percent of the hospitals of the Department in 2014 did not have \\n        enough psychiatrists to meet demand.\\n            (7) The Inspector General found that a significant \\n        proportion of the psychiatrists of the Department saw in excess \\n        of 800 to 900 veterans per year and some veterans were only \\n        seen once per year because of the demand.\\n            (8) A study by the National Institutes of Health identified \\n        the lack of available female-specific medical services and wait \\n        times as key barriers to female veterans seeking health care at \\n        medical facilities of the Department.\\n            (9) The Veterans Access, Choice, and Accountability Act of \\n        2014 (Public Law 113-146) made great strides toward providing \\n        veterans with more flexibility to seek health care in the \\n        setting of choice by the veteran, however, the metrics \\n        established by the Act to determine which veterans were \\n        eligible for such flexibility are insufficient.\\n            (10) Other impediments to veterans receiving health care at \\n        medical facilities of the Department can include long commutes \\n        on group transport, or having to cross bridges or State lines \\n        to receive care.\\n            (11) Many veterans like the health care provided by the \\n        Department and the hospitals of the Department hold particular \\n        expertise in treating ailments of veterans.\\n            (12) Veterans should have the option to stay with the \\n        Department if the veteran likes the health care system of the \\n        Department.\\n\\nSEC. 3.
